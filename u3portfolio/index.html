    <p>The internet is a thing that we carry around in our pockets, and at home. However, the internet was not always as accessible as today. Below is a timeline of the development and creation of the internet.</p>

    <h2>Future Developments of the Internet</h2>
    <p>I believe that the internet will be more user customized, such as recognizing your voice. I also think the internet will still grow as a hub for information. With the growth, the security of the internet will grow also. I think the internet is in a good place right now, but I also believe it will take over literature, and will make things like libraries and bookstores to switch to a digital version.</p>
